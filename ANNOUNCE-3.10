Release 3.10 of "mkdrawf", my tool for creating drawfiles,
is now available. It's enormously better than the previous
released version; the main changes are:

  - Syntactic improvements:                                 _
      - The ability to write expressions in infix notation   \___
      - *Sensible* passing of parameters to macros          _/   `.
      - A much nicer For loop syntax (two, even!)                 |
      - Symbolic names for common colours                         |
  - Semantic improvements:                              These two alone make
      - Some new mathematical operators                 a *big* difference to
      - Specification of JPEG objects is easier         how nice mkdrawf is
      - Support for circular arcs                       to use.
      - Some bugs fixed
  - Cosmetic improvements:
      - Manual reformatted and brought up to date
      - Error handling is *very* slightly better
      - Debugging is easier

You can get it by anonymous FTP at
  ftp://g.pet.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/mkdrawf-3.10.arc
or on the web at
  http://g.pet.cam.ac.uk/~gjm11/software.html
(in fact, the "download" link at the latter place
just points to the former).

For those who don't know: "mkdrawf" is a powerful tool for making
drawfiles; it is a (rather nasty) programming language in its own
right. It comes with a tool that turns drawfiles into "mkdrawf"
input files; it's sometimes useful to do that, munge the file with
perl somehow, and then use "mkdrawf" to produce a modified drawfile.

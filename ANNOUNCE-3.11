This is release 3.11 for the `mkdrawf` tools. It has been released as open
source software under the MIT license. The release here has been created
from the last archives available, and updated to build for both RISC OS
and for POSIX systems (with limitations). Other than the build for non-RISC OS
systems, there are no functional improvements in this release.

Changes from 3.10:

* MIT license added.
* Assembler code has been updated to be 32-bit safe (though will still build
  for 26-bit is necessary).
* C-specific variants of the assembler functions have been created for use
  on non-RISC OS systems.
* Documentation, where possible, has been updated to be in Latin-1 only rather
  than using the RISC OS-specific 0x80-0x9F codes for hyphens, spaces and
  quotation marks.
* Git management files (.gitignore, .gitattributes, .github/*) have been added.
* `mkdrawf` updated to build on non-RISC OS systems:
    * It can use metrics for the standard RISC OS fonts and a custom text
      sizer. Right-to-left text and kerning are not supported.
    * GSTrans replacement function, using environment variables.
    * Bounding boxes for paths use the 'sloppy' method of calculating the size
      of the path. This will result in incorrect boxes, but the Drawfile
      should be usable.
* CI builds should now be created, and a release process will allow these
  to be created for others to use.
* GitHub issue and PR templates exist to help others contribute.



Statement from Gareth McCaughan, 6th December 2025:

------
Well, as I haven't touched it for literally decades:

I hereby release the sources for mkdrawf under the MIT licence.

To be explicit:

mkdrawf is copyright (C) 1995-1998 Gareth McCaughan.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of
the mkdrawf software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to
deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies
of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do
so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS

COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER
IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

The above is a brief copyright notice plus exactly the standard text of the MIT
Licence except that for clarity I have written "the mkdrawf software" instead of
"this software". If you are putting it on GitHub, then adding a file called
LICENCE or LICENSE or something containing "Copyright (C) 1995-1998 Gareth
McCaughan" plus exactly the usual MIT Licence text is entirely acceptable to me.

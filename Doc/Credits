All the code in mkdrawf is mine (so far...)

However, I have a few people to thank for their ideas:

  - My wife Emma; she's a maths teacher, and I originally wrote mkdrawf
    because it seemed like the easiest way to produce diagrams for some
    worksheets she was working on.

  - Anthony Frost, of Online Media, for requesting many features which
    are (in my opinion) good ideas. Also for spotting a number of bugs
    before I did.

  - Alexander Thoukydides, for pressuring me to make mkdrawf calculate
    bounding boxes *properly* rather than just taking the convex hull
    of the individual points.

  - Alun Jones, for spotting, and sending me a fix for, a serious bug
    in the bounding-box computation code.

  - Oliver Schoen, for helpful suggestions and bug reports.

I should also thank Donald E. Knuth, though I've never met him or
corresponded with him, for the source code for TeX and METAFONT,
which he published; they have taught me a lot about how to make
macro-expansion languages slightly less awful than they otherwise
might be. His work has also done much to shape my idea of what
program documentation should be like, but he should not be blamed
for my misjudgements.

    This is some text I'm putting in a text area.
    I have no idea how it will look, nor indeed whether
    it will work at all. For all I know \2mkdrawf\1 will
    just choke utterly on it, or corrupt my file, or
    cause demons to fly out of the monitor.
    This should be a new paragraph; it will still be
    in italics. \2 Now we should be in roman type.
    (Isn't this fun, boys and girls?)

    Apparently the 1998 World Cup will be decided,
    in the event of a draw, by a sudden-death playoff
    instead of by a penalty shootout. How interesting.
